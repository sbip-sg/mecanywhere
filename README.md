# Overview

This repository contains the services for the MECAnywhere project that are used to interact with pymeca and the smart contracts. Use the pymeca-actors to join the MECAnywhere ecosystem now!

# Quick Start (local development)
1. Configure keys/env variables (see [Configuration -> Secret keys](#secret-keys))

2. Pull submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive` in `pymeca` folder.

3. Run docker services
- `docker compose up` to start all services as containers. 
- `docker compose up --build <service_name>` to rebuild a specific service.
- \+ `-f docker-compose-internal.yaml` is for working with pymeca library changes.
- \+ `-f docker-compose.yaml` is for working with pymeca version from pypi.

# Configuration

Options: manual, docker local (recommended), docker testnet

### Secret keys
- For manual:
    - Secret keys can be loaded in `.env` in each service folder. Follow the `.env.example` file for the required variables. 
- For docker local/testnet:
    - Secret keys are loaded by creating a `keys` folder in this base directory where `compose.yaml` is. Each file contains the secret key and the file name is the name of the secret. Required variables are shown in [`compose.yaml`](compose.yaml). 
        - For python services, you have to add your variables in the settings class in `config.py` too.

#### List of keys
> Format: _key: value_

> See compose files for the dependent services of each key.
- `tower_private_key.txt`: private key of the wallet/account for tower actor that calls the smart contracts
