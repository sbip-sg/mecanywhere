Deployment
===========

We have launched our smart contracts on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet (address: ``0x56873484BFB38789624ADeff6aF642A41246976f``). You can get free testnet ETH from the `Sepolia Testnet Faucet <https://faucet.sepolia.io/>`__ and use those accounts to interact with the MECAnywhere network.
To configure for Sepolia:

- MECA_BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/nf3vIJJEKzQWwbKW1UHXvw1aKAeE6B97
- MECA_DAO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x56873484BFB38789624ADeff6aF642A41246976f

To deploy the MECA contracts on your own network, you can use the scripts in the pymeca repository -> ``pymeca/src/pymeca/scripts/deploy.py``.
